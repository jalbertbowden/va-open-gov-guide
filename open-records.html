            <h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
            <p>The Virginia general assembly enacted the Freedom of information act (“the act”) in 1968. Through this act, the legislature sought to secure to the Commonwealth’s citizens access to public records and meetings not specifically exempted by law.</p>
            <p>The act has undergone numerous revisions. Some amendments have strengthened the act by authorizing the award of civil penalties and attorneys’ fees for non-compliance, or by shifting the burden to prove the applicability of exclusions onto the public body. Other amendments, particularly the act’s steadily growing list of discretionary exclusions have narrowed its effectiveness. Finally, some amendents, particularly those relating to electronic meetings and records, have responded to technological changes in the way that information is recorded, processed and delivered.</p>
            <p>The general assembly has mandated that the act be “liberally construed to promote an increased awareness by all persons of governmental activities and afford every opportunity to citizens to witness the operations of government.” Moreover, the act’s exemptions are to “be narrowly construed in order that no thing which should be public may be hidden from any person.”</p>
            <p>These rules of construction are consistently acknowledged by the courts, but not always applied with full vigor. Virginia courts often appear reluctant to provide a remedy under the act unless there is a substantial and willful violation of its provisions. However, where such evidence exists, the courts have shown their willingness to penalize those who attempt to deny to the public that which they have a right to know.</p>
            <p>Opinions of the attorney general of Virginia do not bind the Virginia courts, but are persuasive authority. They are occasionally, but not comprehensively, cited in this outline because they are frequently relied upon by public bodies subject to the act. in addition, a growing body of opinions has been issued by the Virginia Freedom of information advisory Council, created by the general assembly in 2000, to act as a source of both formal and informal advice for citizens, including public officials and press representatives. To date, the opinions of the Council, which are not binding on the courts, have shown a tendency toward the “middle of the road” rather than an aggressive proaccess bias. They are available online, and are not cited in this outline. However, anyone researching an issue under the act is well-served to search both attorney general and advisory Council opinions for relevant discussion of these statutes.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>i. STATUTE -- BASIC APPLICATION
                <ol class="sub-ol">
                  <li>A. Who can request records?
                    <ol class="sub-sub-ol">
                      <li>1. Status of requestor.
                        <ol class="sub-sub-sub-ol">
                          <li>a. Citizens of the Commonwealth: any citizen of the Commonwealth may inspect records during the regular business hours of the custodian of records. A citizen is defined elsewhere in the Code of Virginia as one born in the Commonwealth who has not in good faith become a citizen of another state or one born in another state of this Union or an alien naturalized under the laws of the United States who may be or become a resident of the Commonwealth. Previously found in  Va. Code ann. § § 1-18 and 1-20 (repealed). nothing in the Freedom of information act (“the act”) prohibits a citizen from making a request on behalf of a non-citizen, as the requester is not required to explain or otherwise justify the request. The custodian may require the requester to provide his name and legal address. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(a).</li>
                          <li>b. Media: The act specifically grants rights to representatives of newspapers and magazines with circulation in the Commonwealth and to representatives of television and radio stations broadcasting in or into the Commonwealth. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(a).</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li>2. Purpose of request.
                        <ol class="sub-sub-sub-ol">
                          <li>a. Purpose and Motivation: The purpose or motivation behind a request is irrelevant to a citizen’s entitlement to requested information. See Associated Tax Service v. Fitzpatrick, 236 Va. 181, 372 S.E.2d 625 (1988).</li>
                          <li>b. Reasonable Specificity Required: The act provides that the request shall designate the requested documents with reasonable specificity. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B).</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li>3. Use of records.
                        <ol class="sub-sub-sub-ol">
                          <li>a. No Restriction on Use: The act does not restrict the use of the information obtained.</li>
                          <li>b. Commercial Purposes: a request under the act is not automatically invalid because it was made for a purpose other than to monitor government operations. it is permissible for a citizen to secure information under the act for commercial purposes. See Associated Tax Service v. Fitzpatrick, 236 Va. 181, 372 S.E.2d 625 (1988).</li>
                        </ol>

                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>B. Whose records are and are not subject to the act?
                    <p>The act applies to public bodies, defined to include all government entities such as elected bodies, agencies, authorities, boards, bureaus, commissions, councils, districts or other public bodies at any level of state, regional, county or municipal government. Constitutional officers are considered public bodies and, generally, have the same obligations to disclose public records as other custodians of public records. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701. Corporations organized by the Virginia Retirement System are “public bodies” for the purposes of this chapter. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.</p>
                    <ol class="sub-sub-ol">
                      <li>1. Executive Branch.
                        <ol class="sub-sub-sub-ol">
                          <li>a. records of the executives themselves. Working papers and correspondence prepared by or for the following are exempted from disclosure: Office of the governor, Lieutenant governor and attorney general; the mayor or other chief executive office of any political subdivision of the Commonwealth; and the president or chief executive officer of any public institution of higher education. See Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3705.7(2); see also Taylor v. Worrell Enterprises, 242 Va. 219, 409 S.E.2d 136 (1991)(holding that an itemized list of long distance calls placed by the governor’s office falls within the working papers exemption). no record that is otherwise open to inspection shall be deemed exempt by virtue of the fact that it has been attached to or incorporated within any working paper or correspondence. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3705.7(2).</li>
                          <li>b. records of certain but not all functions. “Working papers” are defined functionally as records prepared by or for a public official for his personal or deliberative use. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3705.7(2).</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li>2. Legislative Bodies.
                        <p>Working papers and correspondence prepared by or for members of the general assembly or the Division of Legislative Services are exempted from disclosure. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3705.7(2).</p></li>
                      <li>3. Courts.
                        <p>Petit juries and grand juries are specifically excluded from coverage under the act. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3703(a)(2). access to judicial records and proceedings is governed by other Virginia statutes and by case law. See, e.g., Va. Code ann. § 17.1-208.</p>
                        <p>Reports and court documents concerning involuntary admissions that are required to be kept confidential pursuant to Va. Code ann. § 37.2-818 are excluded. Va. Code ann.§ 2.2-3705.5(6).</p></li>
                      <li>4. Nongovernmental Bodies.
                        <ol class="sub-sub-sub-ol">
                          <li>a. Bodies receiving public funds or benefits.
                            <p>The act defines “public body” to include “organizations, corporations or agencies in the Commonwealth supported wholly or principally by public funds.” Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  Whether an entity is supported “principally” by public funds is a question of fact. Wigand v. Wilkes, 65 Va. Cir. 437, 438 (Norfolk Cir. Ct. 2004).  Nongovernmental organizations, corporations and agencies that are not supported principally by public funds are not “public bodies” under the act, and, thus are not subject to its disclosure requirements. 1995 Va. Op. Atty gen. 4 (January 9, 1995)(The general assembly did not intend for the act to apply to a private corporation receiving public funds to pay for property, goods, or services it provides, when that corporation is not supported wholly or principally by public funds.).</p></li>
                          <li>b. Bodies whose members include governmental officials.
                            <p>The presence of a government official on the governing body of an entity does not make the entity a public body. The body must meet the statutory definition, or be performing a delegated function of a public body as discussed below.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                      <li>5. Multi-state or regional bodies.
                        <p>Such bodies are not statutorily exempt from the act. a circuit court has held that the act applies to a county industrial Development authority. Lee Jackson Motel Inc., et al v. Industrial Development Authority, 4 Va. Cir. 125 (Frederick Cir. Ct. 1983).</p></li>
                      <li>6. Advisory boards and commissions, quasigovernmental entities.
                        <p>The act applies to any committee or subcommittee, or other entity however designated, of the public body created to perform delegated functions of the public body or to advise the public body. Va. Code Ann. § 2.2-3701. The presence of private sector or citizen members on such a body does not excuse the body from application of the act.</p></li>
                      <li>7. Others.
                        <p>Among other groups excluded from disclosure under the act are (i) Parole Boards (Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3703(a)(1)), (ii) The Virginia State Crime Commission (Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3703(a)(4), and (iii) family assessment and planning teams established pursuant to § 2.2-5207 (§ 2.2-3703(a)(3)).</p></li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>C. What records are and are not subject to the act?
                    <p>Consultant reports. nonexempt portions of a report of a consultant hired by or at the request of a local public body or the mayor or chief executive or administrative officer of such public body are subject to the act if (i) the contents of such report have been distributed or disclosed to members of the local public body or (ii) the local public body has scheduled any action on a matter that is the subject of the consultant’s report. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3705.8(B).</p>
                    <p>Settlements by the Commonwealth. no settlement of a civil action against the Commonwealth involving money damages may be made subject to a confidentiality agreement prohibiting the disclosure of the settlement amount except where required by law or imposed by a court. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-514.</p>
                    <p>Judicial Inquiry. any evidence of alleged misconduct concerning a judge who is up for election or reelection that is transmitted to the House and Senate Committees for Courts of Justice or to any member of the general assembly loses its confidential character. Va. Code ann. § 17.1-918(B).</p>
                    <ol class="sub-sub-ol">
                      <li>1. What kind of records are covered?
                        <ol class="sub-sub-sub-ol">
                          <li>a. General Definition of Records: “Public records” subject to the act are defined as “all writings and recordings that consist of letters, words or numbers, or their equivalent, set down by handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostatting, photography, magnetic impulse, optical or magneto-optical form, mechanical or electronic recording or other form of data compilation, however stored, and regardless of physical form or characteristics, prepared or owned by, or in the possession of a public body or its officers, employees or agents in the transaction of public business.” Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.</li>
                          <li>b. Existing Records: The act applies only to records in existence and in custody of the public body at the time the request for official records is received. 1991 Va. atty. gen. 13 (June 21, 1991). The act does not require that a public body create or prepare a particular record if it does not already exist. See Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(D); see also Hale v. Washington, 241 Va. 76, 400 S.E.2d 175 (1991); National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation v. Greenlief, 27 Va. Cir. 140 (1992). However, the public body may summarize or abstract the information under terms agreed upon by the requester and the public body. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(D).</li>
                          <li>c. Types of Records: Public records maintained by a public body on a computer or other electronic data processing system shall be made available to the public at a reasonable cost. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(g). Videotapes, magnetic tapes, photographs, sound recordings are records subject to disclosure. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701. Booking photographs and mug shots are official records subject to disclosure under the act. 1990 Va. Op. atty. gen. 9 (august 30, 1990). But see Archer v. Mayes, 213 Va. 633, 194 S.E.2d 707 (1973)(Jury list is not an “official record” within the meaning of the act); cf. 1998 Va. Op. Atty. gen. 5 (September 23, 1998)(audio tapes, lyric sheets and other materials submitted to State Song Committee competition constitute “official records” within the meaning of this act).</li>

                      <li>3. are certain records available for inspection but not copying?
                        <p>There is no distinction with respect to what may be copied and what may be inspected. The act provides that “all public records shall be open to inspection and copying.” Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(a).</p></li>

                        <p>Fees Limited to Cost: Charges for time expended in accessing, duplicating, supplying or searching records may not exceed actual cost to the public body in supplying the records. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(F). This limit also applies to records maintained on a computer or other data processing system. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(g); see also 1989 Va. Op. atty gen. 12 (February 21, 1989)(Town may not charge newspaper reporter for the salary of town employee whose sole function for the time charged was to watch the reporter as he inspected the minutes of the town council.). note the exception in the act for the costs of creating certain topographical maps. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(F).</p>
                        <p>Estimates: an advance cost estimate must be provided if requested by the citizen. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(F).</p>

                        <p>There are no provisions to waive fees, but in practice fees frequently are not imposed for small requests.</p></li>
                      <li>4. requirements or prohibitions regarding advance payment.
                        <p>If the public body determines in advance that search and copying charges are likely to exceed $200.00, the public body may require the citizen to pay, before processing the request, an amount not to exceed the amount of the advance determination. The deposit shall be credited toward the final cost of supplying the records. Va. Code ann.§ 2.2-3704(H). Before processing a request for records, a public body may require the requester to pay any amounts owed to the public body for previous requests for records that remain unpaid 30 days or more after billing. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(i).</p></li>
                      <li>5. Have agencies imposed prohibitive fees to discourage requesters?
                        <p>This behavior is encountered on occasion, generally at the local government level.</p></li>

                  <li>E. Who enforces the act?
                    <p>Any person, including the attorney for the Commonwealth acting in his official or individual capacity, denied the rights and privileges conferred by this chapter may proceed to enforce such rights and privileges by filing a petition for mandamus or injunction.

For a second or subsequent violation, such civil penalty shall be not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,500. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3714.</p>

Code ann. § § 2.2-3705.1 to -3705.7.  all exemptions are to “be narrowly construed” so as to not “discourage the free discussion by government officials or employees of public matters with the citizens of the Commonwealth.” Va.

                    All state public bodies created in the executive branch of state government and subject to the provisions of the VFOia must provide to the public upon request: (1) an explanation of the rights of a requester, the procedures to obtain public records from the public body, and the responsibilities of the public body in complying with the VFOia; (2) contact information for the person designated by the public body to assist a requester in making a request or to respond to requests; and (3) a general description of the types of records maintained by that public body; (4) a general description of any exemptions in the law that permit or require records to be withheld from release; and (5) any policy the public body has concerning the type of public records it routinely withholds from release as permitted by the VFOia. in addition, that information must also be posted on the internet. Virginia Code § 2.2-3704.1(a).  
                    <ol class="sub-sub-ol">
                      <li>1. Who receives a request?
                        The request should be directed to the agency that is the custodian of the records that are being sought.  The governor is not the custodian of records for each and every public body in the Commonwealth. Davis v. Allen, 44 Va. Cir. 237 (1997).</li>
                      <li>2. Does the law cover oral requests?
                        Yes, the act does not mandate that the request be written. it is advisable, however, that the request be written if the requester anticipates a need to enforce his or her rights under the act.

                          <li>a. arrangements to inspect &#38; copy.
                            requests for records must identify the requested records with reasonable specificity. The requester need not make reference to the act. The public body shall reply within five (5) working days. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B). all public records shall be open to inspection and copying during regular business hours of the custodian of such records. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(a). The public body may make reasonable charges for the actual cost of duplicating the records. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(F).</li>
                          <li>b. if an oral request is denied:
                            The act does not distinguish oral from written requests. The requester may pursue the remedies outlined in the act upon denial. See Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3714. if litigation is contemplated, it is wise to resubmit the request in writing. in the interest of establishing an unambiguous record, written follow up to a denied oral request is recommended.</li>

                            The act requires that the request shall identify the requested records with reasonable specificity. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B). Fishing expeditions will not be allowed.</li>
                          <li>b. need to address fee issues.
                            The act does not require that fees be mentioned in the request. However, if requesting an estimate for search and copying charges, it is best to put it in writing. if the requester asks for an estimate, one must be provided. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(F).  
                            If a public body determines in advance that charges for producing the requested records are likely to exceed $200, the public body may, before continuing to process the request, require the requester to agree to payment of a deposit not to exceed the amount of the advance determination. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(H).</li>

                            The right to inspect and copy records, including future access to records, can be waived. Putnam v. City of Winchester, 47 Va.

                  <li>B. How long to wait.
                    Five Day Initial Response: The custodian must provide an initial response within five working days of receipt of the request, informing the requester of one of the following:  The requested records will be provided. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B).
                    all of the requested records are exempt from disclosure. a written explanation must be provided explaining why the records are unavailable, making specific reference to the relevant code provision. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B)(1).
                    The requested records that are not exempt will be provided. a written explanation must be provided explaining why some records are being withheld and must name the specific code section authorizing the exemption. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B)(2).
                    The requested records could not be found or do not exist. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B)(3).
                    it is practically impossible to provide the requested documents or to determine whether they are available within the five working days prescribed and, therefore, the custodian shall have an additional seven (7) working days to provide one of the three aforementioned responses. 
                    Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B)(4).  
                    Responding with an answer not found in the act does not constitute a response for the act’s purposes. Fenter v. Norfolk Airport Authority, 274 Va. 524 (2007)(informing the requester that the request has been send to a federal authority is insufficient).  
                    Additional Time to Respond: The custodian may obtain an additional seven (7) days pursuant to § 2.2-3704(B)(4) as long as he provides an initial response within five days. The custodian also may petition the appropriate court for additional time if there is an extraordinary volume of records requested and a response within the time limit will prevent the public body from meeting its operational responsibilities.

                      <li>2. Priority.
                        Suits to enforce the provisions of the act must be heard within seven days of filing. However, if the court is not in its regular term, the hearing must be given precedence over all other cases which are not otherwise given precedence. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(C).</li>
                      <li>3. Pro se.
                        The act does not require that a requester to be represented by an attorney. it has been held that a person who appears pro se cannot receive attorney fees for a suit to enforce the act; however, he may recover court costs. Fiscella v. ARHA, 50 Va. Cir. 102 (1999). The act overrides Virginia’s general ethical prohibition on the appearance of a corporate party without counsel. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(B).</li>
                      <li>4. issues the court will address:
                        In accordance with a greater weight of the evidence standard, the Court will generally determine whether the public body has violated the act by either failing to timely respond to the request or improperly withholding records which are not exempted by the act. See RF&#38;P Corp. v. Little, 247 Va. 309, 440 S.E.2d 908(1994)(standard of proof). The public body bears the burden to prove its entitlement to an exception by a preponderance of the evidence. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(E).  “a citizen alleging violation of the rights and privileges afforded by the FOia and seeking relief by mandamus pursuant to Code § 2.2-3713(a) is not required to prove a lack of an adequate remedy at law, nor can the mandamus proceeding be barred on the ground that there may be some other remedy at law available.” Cartwright v. Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner, 270 Va. 58, 613 S.E.2d 449 (2005). Request For Injunctive Relief: The Court will determine whether the violation was willful, knowing, and substantial. injunction will not be granted where the procedural violation of the act is minor and unintended. Shenandoah Publishing House Inc. v. Winchester City Council, 37 Va. Cir. 149 (1994).  Entitlement to Fees: Where the petitioner has substantially prevailed on the merits of the case, attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs shall be awarded, unless special circumstances make such an award unjust. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(D). See Redinger v. Casteen, 36 Va. Cir. 479 (1995).  Imposition of Penalties: The Court will determine whether there has been a willful and knowing violation of the act. if so, a civil penalty will be imposed, as well as possibly a writ of mandamus or injunctive relief. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3714. RF&#38;P Corporation v. Little, 247 Va. 309, 440 S.E.2d 908 (1994). Penalties will not be assessed where there is a technical violation of the act. Mannix v.
