introductory note
The OPEn gOVErnMEnT gUiDE is a compre-
hensive guide to open government law and practice in 
each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Fifty-
one outlines detail the rights of reporters and other citi-
zens to see information and attend meetings of state and 
local governments.
The OPEn gOVErnMEnT gUiDE — previously 
published as Tapping Officials’ Secrets — is the sole ref-
erence on open government laws in many states.
Written to follow a standard outline to allow easy com-
parisons between state laws, the compendium has enabled 
open government advocates in one state to use arguments 
successful in other states to enhance access rights at home. 
Press associations and lobbyists have been able to invoke 
other sunshine laws as they seek reforms in their own.
Volunteer attorneys, expert in open government laws in 
each state and in Washington, D.C., generously donated 
their time to prepare the initial outlines for the first incar-
nation of this project in 1989. in most states these same 
attorneys or their close associates updated and rewrote 
the outlines for the 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2006 editions 
as well this current 2011 edition.
attorneys who are new to the compendium in this edi-
tion are also experts in open government and access is-
sues, and we are grateful to them for their willingness to 
share in this ongoing project to create the first and only 
detailed treatise on state open government law. The rich 
knowledge and experience all the participating attorneys 
bring to this project make it a success.
While most of the initial users of this compendium 
were journalists, we know that lawyers and citizens have 
discovered it and find it to be indispensable as well.
at its core, participatory democracy decries locked files 
and closed doors. good citizens study their governors, 
challenge the decisions they make and petition or vote for 
change when change is needed. But no citizen can carry 
out these responsibilities when government is secret.
assurances of open government exist in the common 
law, in the first state laws after colonization, in territorial 
laws in the west and even in state constitutions. all states 
have passed laws requiring openness, often in direct re-
sponse to the scandals spawned by government secrecy. 
The U.S. Congress strengthened the federal Freedom 
of information act after Watergate, and many states fol-
lowed suit.
States with traditionally strong access laws include Ver-
mont, which provides virtually unfettered access on many 
levels; Florida, which was one of the first states to enact 
a sunshine law; and Ohio, whose courts have issued sev-
eral access-friendly rulings. Other jurisdictions, such as 
Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia, have made 
significant changes to their respective open government 
laws since the fifth edition was published designed to 
foster greater public access to information. Historically, 
Pennsylvania had a reputation as being relatively non-
transparent while the District of Columbia was known to 
have a very restrictive open meetings law.
Some public officials in state and local governments 
work hard to achieve and enforce open government laws. 
The movement toward state freedom of information 
compliance officers reflects a growing activism for access 
to information in the states.
But such official disposition toward openness is excep-
tional. Hardly a day goes by when we don’t hear that a 
state or local government is trying to restrict access to 
records that have traditionally been public — usually be-
cause it is feared release of the records will violate some-
one’s “privacy” or threaten our nation’s security.
it is in this climate of tension between broad demo-
cratic mandates for openness and official preference for 
secrecy that reporters and good citizens need to garner 
their resources to ensure the passage and success of open 
government laws.
The reporters Committee genuinely hopes that the 
OPEn gOVErnMEnT gUiDE will help a vigor-
ous press and citizenry to shape and achieve demands for 
openness, and that it will serve as a primer for those who 
battle in government offices and in the courts for access 
to records and meetings. When challenges to secrecy are 
successful, the news is better and so is the government.
