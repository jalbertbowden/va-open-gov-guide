User’s guide
Whether you are using a guide from one state to find a 
specific answer to an access issue, or the complete com-
pendium encompassing all states to survey approaches to 
a particular aspect of open government law around the 
country, knowing a few basics on how the OPEn gOV-
ErnMEnT gUiDE is set up will help you to get the 
most out of it.
Following the outline. Every state section is based on the 
same standard outline. The outline is divided into two 
parts: access to records and access to meetings.
Start by reviewing the table of contents for each state. 
it includes the first two tiers of that state’s outline. Once 
you are familiar with the structure of the outline, finding 
specific information is simple. Typically, the outline be-
gins by describing the general structure of the state law, 
then provides detailed topical listings explaining access 
policies for specific kinds of records or meetings.
Every state outline follows the standard outline, but 
there will be some variations. Some contributors added 
items within the outline, or omitted subpoints found in 
the complete outline which were not relevant to that 
state’s law. Each change was made to fit the needs of a 
particular state’s laws and practices.
in general, outline points that appear in boldface type 
are part of the standard outline, while additional topics 
will appear in italicized type.
Whether you are using one state outline or any number 
of outlines, we think you will find the outline form help-
ful in finding specific information quickly without having 
to read an entire statute or search through many court 
cases. But when you do need to consult statutes, you will 
find the complete text of the relevant portions at the end 
of each outline.
additional copies of individual state booklets, or of the 
compendium covering the 50 states and the District of 
Columbia, can be ordered from The reporters Commit-
tee for Freedom of the Press, 1101 Wilson Blvd., Suite 
1100, arlington, Virginia 22209, or by calling (703) 807-
2100. The compendium is available in electronic format 
on CD.
The state outlines also are available on our World-Wide 
Web site, www.rcfp.org/ogg. The internet version of the 
outlines allows you to search the database and compare 
the law in different states.
Updates: The reporters Committee published new 
editions of THE OPEn gOVErnMEnT gUiDE in 
1989, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2006, and now in 2011. We ex-
pect future updates to follow on approximately the same 
schedule. if we become aware of mistakes or material 
omissions in this work, we will post notices on this proj-
ect’s page on our World-Wide Web site, at www.rcfp.org/
ogg. This does not mean that the outlines will constantly 
be updated on the site  — it simply means known errors 
will be corrected there.
For our many readers who are not lawyers: This book 
is designed to help journalists, lawyers, and citizens un-
derstand and use state open records and meetings law. 
although the guides were written by lawyers, they are 
designed to be useful to and readable by nonlawyers as 
well. However, some of the elements of legal writing may 
be unfamiliar to lay readers. a quick overview of some of 
these customs should suffice to help you over any hurdles.
Lawyers are trained to give a “legal citation” for most 
statements of law. The name of a court case or number 
of a statute may therefore be tacked on to the end of a 
sentence. This may look like a sentence fragment, or may 
leave you wondering if some information about that case 
was omitted. nothing was left out; inclusion of a legal 
citation provides a reference to the case or statute sup-
porting the statement and provides a shorthand method 
of identifying that authority, should you need to locate it.
Legal citation form also indicates where the law can be 
found in official reporters or other legal digests. Typically, 
a cite to a court case will be followed by the volume and 
page numbers of a legal reporter. Most state cases will be 
found in the state reporter, a larger regional reporter, or 
both. a case cite reading 123 a.2d 456 means the case 
could be found in the atlantic (regional) reporter, second 
series, volume 123, starting at page 456.
note that the complete citation for a case is often given 
only once. We have tried to eliminate as many cryptic 
second-reference cites as possible, but you may encoun-
ter cites like “Jackson at 321.” This means that the author 
is referring you to page 321 of a case cited earlier that in-
cludes the name Jackson. authors may also use the words 
supra or infra to refer to a discussion of a case appearing 
earlier or later in the outline, respectively.
Except for these legal citation forms, most “legalese” 
has been avoided. We hope this will make this guide more 
accessible to everyone.
