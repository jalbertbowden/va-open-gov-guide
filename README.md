Virginia Open Government Guide - Access to Public Records and Meetings (RCFP) (6th Edition 2011).

va ogg came to me a prisoner, shackled behind an adobe prison build with solid .pdf bars. that is most certainly no way to live your life out on the web.
after busting va ogg out of proprietary sentencing, i decided it would be best kept here. in multiple flavors, supporting as many standards as needed.
va ogg has only been converted to .txt, and .png at the moment, with plans for .json, .xml, and .html formats to be implemented shortly.

NOTE: the .html that exists with the initial commit is actually the .txt file; will be converting that first.

the .png set is also going to be added to a flickr set/collection, will add url as soon as its completed.

Virginia - Open Government Guide was liberated via http://www.rcfp.org/rcfp/orders/docs/ogg/VA.pdf
content url: http://www.rcfp.org/virginia-open-government-guide
and was created by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, who actually did a superb job and civil service to us all for creating these documents
