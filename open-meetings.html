              <li>I. STATUTE -- BASIC APPLICATION.
                <ol class="sub-ol">
                  <li>A. Who may attend?
                    All meetings shall be open to the public unless the topic of discussion at such meetings falls within one of the enumerated exemptions in § 2.2-3707 or § 2.2-3711(a) and the requisite closure procedures for exempted meetings are followed pursuant to § 2.2-3712.</li>
                  <li>B. What governments are subject to the law?
                    The act applies to all public bodies, defined as “any legislative body, authority, board, bureau, commission, district or agency of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision of the Commonwealth, including cities, towns and counties; municipal councils, governing bodies of counties, school boards and planning commissions; boards of visitors of public institutions of higher education; and other organizations, corporations or agencies in the Commonwealth supported wholly or principally by public funds.” Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.</li>
                  <li>C. What bodies are covered by the law?
1. Executive branch agencies.
The act applies to all public bodies.  
2. Legislative bodies.
The act includes “any legislative body” in its definition of public 
bodies. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
3. Courts.
access to courts is governed by other Virginia statutes and case law. 
Court proceedings are presumed open under case law interpreting the 
Constitutions of the United States and Virginia.  
4. nongovernmental bodies receiving public funds or 
benefits.
Organizations, corporations and agencies that are not supported 
wholly or principally by public funds are exempted from the require-
ments of the act. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
5. nongovernmental groups whose members include 
governmental officials.
“Public body” includes “any committee, subcommittee, or other 
entity however designated, of the public body created to perform del-
egated functions of the public body or to advise the public body. it 
shall not exclude any such committee, subcommittee or entity because 
it has private sector of citizen members.” Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
6. Multi-state or regional bodies.
These bodies are not statutorily exempt from the act. a circuit 
court has held that the act applies to an industrial Development au-
thority. Lee Jackson Motel Inc. v. Industrial Development Authority, 4 Va. 
Cir. 125 (1983).  
7. advisory boards and commissions, quasi-
governmental entities.
See subsection 5 above. it has also been held that certain citizen 
advisory boards are exempt from the act. To qualify for the exemp-
tion, the committee (1) must not have been created by a public body, 
rather than by a member of the body; (2) must not perform a function 
delegated to it by the public body; (3) does not advise a public body; 
and (4) must not receive any public funds, including reimbursement 
for expenses. 1979 Va. Op. atty. gen. 316 (april 3, 1979).

9. appointed as well as elected bodies.
Elected as well as appointed bodies are subject to the act.  
D. What constitutes a meeting subject to the law.
“Meetings” is defined as “the meetings including work sessions, 
when sitting physically, or through telephonic or video equipment 
pursuant to § 2.2-3708 or 2.2-3708.1, as a body or entity, or as an in-
formal assemblage of (i) as many as three members, or (ii) a quorum, if 
less than three, of the constituent membership . . . of any public body.” 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
Members-elect do not count toward the number necessary to con-
stitute a meeting under the VFOia. See Beck v. Shelton, 267 Va. 482, 
488, 593 S.E.2d 195, 198 (2004).  
1. number that must be present.
See above.  
2. nature of business subject to the law.
The act applies if the public body’s business will be discussed or 
transacted in any way. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
a. “information gathering” and “fact-finding” 
sessions.
Work sessions are defined as meetings by § 2.2-3701. However, a 
court opinion suggests that “information gathering” sessions are not 
meetings within the scope of this section. Nageotte v. Board of Supervi-
sors, 223 Va. 259, 269, 288 S.E.2d 423 (1982); but see Little v. Virginia 
Retirement Sys., 28 Va. Cir. 411, 433 (Va. Cir. Ct. 1992) (“Unlike a 
meeting between two separate and distinct entities, with separate and 
distinct areas of responsibility, a meeting involving two inextricably 
linked entities cannot be said to involve the business of only one of 
those entities.”).  
Public Gatherings: Where two city employees and three members of 
City Council were separately invited to a gathering at a street inter-
section to raise awareness over traffic concerns, no meeting within the 
meaning of the VFOia took place. Beck v. Shelton, 267 Va. 482, 493-
94, 593 S.E.2d 195, 200-01 (2004).  
b. Deliberations toward decisions.
a meeting held to discuss or transact public business is still a meet-
ing within the meaning of the act even where no votes are taken or 
decisions made. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
Non-Public Business: a meeting of Board of Supervisors to discuss 
communication and decision making skills is not a meeting subject to 
the provisions of this section. WDBJ Television Inc. v. Roanoke County 
Supervisors, 4 Va. Cir. 349 (1985).  
Informal General Assembly Meetings: The open meeting provisions 
shall not apply to informal meetings or gatherings of members of the 
general assembly. ACLU v. Andrews, 24 Va. Cir. 443 (1991).  
3. Electronic meetings.
Local public bodies are prohibited from meeting via electronic, 
telephonic, or video communications. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3708(a) 
(nevertheless, such communications means may be employed to ex-
pand public participation).  
no regular, special, or reconvened session of the general assembly 
held pursuant to article iV, Section 6 of the Constitution of Virginia 
shall be conducted using electronic communication means pursuant § 
2.2-3708. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3707.01(D).  
a. Conference calls and video/internet 
conferencing.
State public bodies may conduct any meeting to discuss or transact 
public business through electronic communication means. Where a 
quorum of a public body of the Commonwealth is physically assem-
bled at one location for the purpose of conducting a meeting autho-
rized under this section, additional members of such public body may 
participate in the meeting through electronic communication means 
provided such participation is available to the public. if a public body 
holds an electronic meeting pursuant to this section, the public body 
shall also hold at least one meeting annually where members in at-
tendance at the meeting are physically assembled at one location and 
where no members participate by electronic communication means. 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3708(B).  
b. E-mail.
E-mail communications are included within the act’s definition of 
“public records.” Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701. For purposes of electron-
ic meetings, electronic communication means only includes any audio 
or combined audio and visual communication method. Therefore, e-
mail would not be an appropriate medium for conducting a meeting. 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3708(B); see also Beck v. Shelton, 267 Va. 482, 492, 
593 S.E.2d 195, 200 (2004) (determining that e-mail communications 
at issue did not constitute a “meeting” under FOia).  
c. Text messages.
See E-mail section.  
d. instant messaging.
See E-mail section.  
e. Social media and online discussion boards.
See E-mail section.

IV. PROCEDURE FOR ASSERTUNG RIGHT OF ACCESS
a. When to challenge.
Promptly challenging the closure of a meeting is recommended. 
generally, an effort should be made to address the presiding officer, explain that the body is not complying with the requirements of the act, and request reconsideration of the motion to close.  
1. Does the law provide expedited procedure for 
reviewing request to attend upcoming meetings?
no.  
2. When barred from attending.
The individual may petition the court for a writ of mandamus pursuant to the act’s enforcement provisions. § 2.2-3713.  
3. To set aside decision.
The individual may bring a bill of complaint to set aside the public body’s decision in accordance with the act’s enforcement provisions. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713. note, while it appears that if there was a substantial violation of the act, the Virginia Supreme Court would set the public body’s decision aside, they appear to do so reluctantly. They state “[u]nless there is a specific statutory provision for invalidation, courts are generally wary of imposing such a penalty for violation of ‘open meeting’ or ‘right to know’ statutes.” Nageotte v. King George County, 223 Va. 259, 267 n.2, 288 S.E.2d 423, 427 n.2 (1982).  
4. For ruling on future meetings.
The individual may petition the court for injunctive relief in accordance with the act’s enforcement provisions. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713. note that the court will not award injunctive relief where the violations are not willful and substantial. Nageotte v. King George County, 223 Va. 259, 269-70 (1982).  
B. How to start.
in accordance with the provisions of Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713, an aggrieved individual may petition the court for a writ of mandamus or an injunction for alleged violations of the act.  
There are no administrative appeals provided for under the act.  
1. Where to ask for ruling.
a. administrative forum.
C. Court review of administrative decision.
1. Who may sue?
any citizen of the Commonwealth, including the Commonwealth’s attorney, who has been denied the rights and privileges under the act. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(a).  
2. Will the court give priority to the pleading?
Suits to enforce the provisions of the act must be heard within seven (7) days of filing. However, if the court is not in its regular term, the hearing must be given precedence over all other cases which are not otherwise given precedence. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(C).  
3. Pro se possibility, advisability.
The act does not require that a natural person be represented by an attorney. in general district court, Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(B) relaxes the general rule of Virginia law that a corporate entity must be represented by an attorney. generally, assistance of counsel is advisable.  
4. What issues will the court address?
Entitlement to Fees: Where it has been proven that the petitioner substantially has prevailed in showing that there has been a violation of the act, the Court then must determine whether there are special circumstances making an award of attorneys’ fees unjust. Hale v. Washington County Sch. Bd., 241 Va. 76, 82, 400 S.E.2d 175, 178 (1991). See also Redinger v. Casteen, 36 Va. Cir. 479 (1995) (awarding fees).  
Imposition of Penalties: The Court will determine whether there has been a willful violation of the act. Penalties will not be assessed where there is a technical violation of the act. Mannix v. Washington County Board of Supervisors, 27 Va. Cir. 397 (1992).  
a. Open the meeting.
although mandamus and injunctive relief are available, this remedy often is not available given that closure of a meeting has already taken place.  
b. invalidate the decision.
not addressed.  
c. Order future meetings open.
The Court only will restrain a governing body from closing future meetings where there is evidence that there was a willful and substantial violation, and that the violation will likely occur again. Nageotte v. 
King George County, 223 Va. 259, 269-70, 288 S.E.2d 423, 428 (1982). 
5. Pleading format.
Suits for injunctive relief or for a writ of mandamus are equitable remedies, and thus, a suit in equity is appropriate.  
6. Time limit for filing suit.
Suit should be filed without unreasonable delay.  
7. What court.
Suits brought to enforce the provisions of this act shall be filed in the general district court or the circuit court of the county or city from which the public body has been elected or appointed and in which the denial of rights occurred. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(a). Suits against state agencies or standing committees of the general assembly shall be filed in the general district or circuit court of the residence of the aggrieved party or of the City of richmond. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(a).  
8. Judicial remedies available.
The primary remedies are a writ of mandamus or an injunction. 
The former compels compliance with the act and the latter prohibits noncompliance.
