Virginia Open gOVernment guide
iv         The RepoRTeRs CommiTTee foR fReedom of The pRess
introductory note
The OPEn gOVErnMEnT gUiDE is a compre-
hensive guide to open government law and practice in 
each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Fifty-
one outlines detail the rights of reporters and other citi-
zens to see information and attend meetings of state and 
local governments.
The OPEn gOVErnMEnT gUiDE — previously 
published as Tapping Officials’ Secrets — is the sole ref-
erence on open government laws in many states.
Written to follow a standard outline to allow easy com-
parisons between state laws, the compendium has enabled 
open government advocates in one state to use arguments 
successful in other states to enhance access rights at home. 
Press associations and lobbyists have been able to invoke 
other sunshine laws as they seek reforms in their own.
Volunteer attorneys, expert in open government laws in 
each state and in Washington, D.C., generously donated 
their time to prepare the initial outlines for the first incar-
nation of this project in 1989. in most states these same 
attorneys or their close associates updated and rewrote 
the outlines for the 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2006 editions 
as well this current 2011 edition.
attorneys who are new to the compendium in this edi-
tion are also experts in open government and access is-
sues, and we are grateful to them for their willingness to 
share in this ongoing project to create the first and only 
detailed treatise on state open government law. The rich 
knowledge and experience all the participating attorneys 
bring to this project make it a success.
While most of the initial users of this compendium 
were journalists, we know that lawyers and citizens have 
discovered it and find it to be indispensable as well.
at its core, participatory democracy decries locked files 
and closed doors. good citizens study their governors, 
challenge the decisions they make and petition or vote for 
change when change is needed. But no citizen can carry 
out these responsibilities when government is secret.
assurances of open government exist in the common 
law, in the first state laws after colonization, in territorial 
laws in the west and even in state constitutions. all states 
have passed laws requiring openness, often in direct re-
sponse to the scandals spawned by government secrecy. 
The U.S. Congress strengthened the federal Freedom 
of information act after Watergate, and many states fol-
lowed suit.
States with traditionally strong access laws include Ver-
mont, which provides virtually unfettered access on many 
levels; Florida, which was one of the first states to enact 
a sunshine law; and Ohio, whose courts have issued sev-
eral access-friendly rulings. Other jurisdictions, such as 
Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia, have made 
significant changes to their respective open government 
laws since the fifth edition was published designed to 
foster greater public access to information. Historically, 
Pennsylvania had a reputation as being relatively non-
transparent while the District of Columbia was known to 
have a very restrictive open meetings law.
Some public officials in state and local governments 
work hard to achieve and enforce open government laws. 
The movement toward state freedom of information 
compliance officers reflects a growing activism for access 
to information in the states.
But such official disposition toward openness is excep-
tional. Hardly a day goes by when we don’t hear that a 
state or local government is trying to restrict access to 
records that have traditionally been public — usually be-
cause it is feared release of the records will violate some-
one’s “privacy” or threaten our nation’s security.
it is in this climate of tension between broad demo-
cratic mandates for openness and official preference for 
secrecy that reporters and good citizens need to garner 
their resources to ensure the passage and success of open 
government laws.
The reporters Committee genuinely hopes that the 
OPEn gOVErnMEnT gUiDE will help a vigor-
ous press and citizenry to shape and achieve demands for 
openness, and that it will serve as a primer for those who 
battle in government offices and in the courts for access 
to records and meetings. When challenges to secrecy are 
successful, the news is better and so is the government.

User’s guide
Whether you are using a guide from one state to find a 
specific answer to an access issue, or the complete com-
pendium encompassing all states to survey approaches to 
a particular aspect of open government law around the 
country, knowing a few basics on how the OPEn gOV-
ErnMEnT gUiDE is set up will help you to get the 
most out of it.
Following the outline. Every state section is based on the 
same standard outline. The outline is divided into two 
parts: access to records and access to meetings.
Start by reviewing the table of contents for each state. 
it includes the first two tiers of that state’s outline. Once 
you are familiar with the structure of the outline, finding 
specific information is simple. Typically, the outline be-
gins by describing the general structure of the state law, 
then provides detailed topical listings explaining access 
policies for specific kinds of records or meetings.
Every state outline follows the standard outline, but 
there will be some variations. Some contributors added 
items within the outline, or omitted subpoints found in 
the complete outline which were not relevant to that 
state’s law. Each change was made to fit the needs of a 
particular state’s laws and practices.
in general, outline points that appear in boldface type 
are part of the standard outline, while additional topics 
will appear in italicized type.
Whether you are using one state outline or any number 
of outlines, we think you will find the outline form help-
ful in finding specific information quickly without having 
to read an entire statute or search through many court 
cases. But when you do need to consult statutes, you will 
find the complete text of the relevant portions at the end 
of each outline.
additional copies of individual state booklets, or of the 
compendium covering the 50 states and the District of 
Columbia, can be ordered from The reporters Commit-
tee for Freedom of the Press, 1101 Wilson Blvd., Suite 
1100, arlington, Virginia 22209, or by calling (703) 807-
2100. The compendium is available in electronic format 
on CD.
The state outlines also are available on our World-Wide 
Web site, www.rcfp.org/ogg. The internet version of the 
outlines allows you to search the database and compare 
the law in different states.
Updates: The reporters Committee published new 
editions of THE OPEn gOVErnMEnT gUiDE in 
1989, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2006, and now in 2011. We ex-
pect future updates to follow on approximately the same 
schedule. if we become aware of mistakes or material 
omissions in this work, we will post notices on this proj-
ect’s page on our World-Wide Web site, at www.rcfp.org/
ogg. This does not mean that the outlines will constantly 
be updated on the site  — it simply means known errors 
will be corrected there.
For our many readers who are not lawyers: This book 
is designed to help journalists, lawyers, and citizens un-
derstand and use state open records and meetings law. 
although the guides were written by lawyers, they are 
designed to be useful to and readable by nonlawyers as 
well. However, some of the elements of legal writing may 
be unfamiliar to lay readers. a quick overview of some of 
these customs should suffice to help you over any hurdles.
Lawyers are trained to give a “legal citation” for most 
statements of law. The name of a court case or number 
of a statute may therefore be tacked on to the end of a 
sentence. This may look like a sentence fragment, or may 
leave you wondering if some information about that case 
was omitted. nothing was left out; inclusion of a legal 
citation provides a reference to the case or statute sup-
porting the statement and provides a shorthand method 
of identifying that authority, should you need to locate it.
Legal citation form also indicates where the law can be 
found in official reporters or other legal digests. Typically, 
a cite to a court case will be followed by the volume and 
page numbers of a legal reporter. Most state cases will be 
found in the state reporter, a larger regional reporter, or 
both. a case cite reading 123 a.2d 456 means the case 
could be found in the atlantic (regional) reporter, second 
series, volume 123, starting at page 456.
note that the complete citation for a case is often given 
only once. We have tried to eliminate as many cryptic 
second-reference cites as possible, but you may encoun-
ter cites like “Jackson at 321.” This means that the author 
is referring you to page 321 of a case cited earlier that in-
cludes the name Jackson. authors may also use the words 
supra or infra to refer to a discussion of a case appearing 
earlier or later in the outline, respectively.
Except for these legal citation forms, most “legalese” 
has been avoided. We hope this will make this guide more 
accessible to everyone.

The Virginia general assembly enacted the Freedom of informa-
tion act (“the act”) in 1968. Through this act, the legislature sought 
to secure to the Commonwealth’s citizens access to public records and 
meetings not specifically exempted by law.  
The act has undergone numerous revisions. Some amendments 
have strengthened the act by authorizing the award of civil penal-
ties and attorneys’ fees for non-compliance, or by shifting the burden 
to prove the applicability of exclusions onto the public body. Other 
amendments, particularly the act’s steadily growing list of discretion-
ary exclusions have narrowed its effectiveness. Finally, some amend-
ments, particularly those relating to electronic meetings and records, 
have responded to technological changes in the way that information 
is recorded, processed and delivered.  
The general assembly has mandated that the act be “liberally con-
strued to promote an increased awareness by all persons of govern-
mental activities and afford every opportunity to citizens to witness 
the operations of government.” Moreover, the act’s exemptions are to 
“be narrowly construed in order that no thing which should be public 
may be hidden from any person.”  
These rules of construction are consistently acknowledged by the 
courts, but not always applied with full vigor. Virginia courts often 
appear reluctant to provide a remedy under the act unless there is a 
substantial and willful violation of its provisions. However, where such 
evidence exists, the courts have shown their willingness to penalize 
those who attempt to deny to the public that which they have a right 
to know.  
Opinions of the attorney general of Virginia do not bind the Vir-
ginia courts, but are persuasive authority. They are occasionally, but 
not comprehensively, cited in this outline because they are frequently 
relied upon by public bodies subject to the act. in addition, a growing 
body of opinions has been issued by the Virginia Freedom of informa-
tion advisory Council, created by the general assembly in 2000, to 
act as a source of both formal and informal advice for citizens, includ-
ing public officials and press representatives. To date, the opinions of 
the Council, which are not binding on the courts, have shown a ten-
dency toward the “middle of the road” rather than an aggressive pro-
access bias. They are available online, and are not cited in this outline. 
However, anyone researching an issue under the act is well-served 
to search both attorney general and advisory Council opinions for 
relevant discussion of these statutes.  
Open records
i. STaTUTE -- BaSiC aPPLiCaTiOn
a. Who can request records?
1. Status of requestor.
a. Citizens of the Commonwealth: any citizen of the Commonwealth 
may inspect records during the regular business hours of the custodian 
of records. a citizen is defined elsewhere in the Code of Virginia as 
one born in the Commonwealth who has not in good faith become a 
citizen of another state or one born in another state of this Union or 
an alien naturalized under the laws of the United States who may be 
or become a resident of the Commonwealth. Previously found in  Va. 
Code ann. § § 1-18 and 1-20 (repealed). nothing in the Freedom of 
information act (“the act”) prohibits a citizen from making a request 
on behalf of a non-citizen, as the requester is not required to explain or 
otherwise justify the request. The custodian may require the requester 
to provide his name and legal address. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(a).  
b. Media: The act specifically grants rights to representatives of 
newspapers and magazines with circulation in the Commonwealth and 
to representatives of television and radio stations broadcasting in or 
into the Commonwealth. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(a).  
2. Purpose of request.
a. Purpose and Motivation: The purpose or motivation behind a re-
quest is irrelevant to a citizen’s entitlement to requested information. 
See Associated Tax Service v. Fitzpatrick, 236 Va. 181, 372 S.E.2d 625 
(1988).  
b. Reasonable Specificity Required: The act provides that the request 
shall designate the requested documents with reasonable specificity. 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B).  
3. Use of records.
a. No Restriction on Use: The act does not restrict the use of the 
information obtained.  
b. Commercial Purposes: a request under the act is not automatically 
invalid because it was made for a purpose other than to monitor gov-
ernment operations. it is permissible for a citizen to secure informa-
tion under the act for commercial purposes. See Associated Tax Service 
v. Fitzpatrick, 236 Va. 181, 372 S.E.2d 625 (1988).  
B. Whose records are and are not subject to the act?
The act applies to public bodies, defined to include all government 
entities such as elected bodies, agencies, authorities, boards, bureaus, 
commissions, councils, districts or other public bodies at any level of 
state, regional, county or municipal government. Constitutional offi-
cers are considered public bodies and, generally, have the same obliga-
tions to disclose public records as other custodians of public records. 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701. Corporations organized by the Virginia 
retirement System are “public bodies” for the purposes of this chap-
ter. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
1. Executive branch.
a. records of the executives themselves.
Working papers and correspondence prepared by or for the follow-
ing are exempted from disclosure: Office of the governor, Lieuten-
ant governor and attorney general; the mayor or other chief execu-
tive office of any political subdivision of the Commonwealth; and the 
president or chief executive officer of any public institution of higher 
education. See Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3705.7(2); see also Taylor v. Wor-
rell Enterprises, 242 Va. 219, 409 S.E.2d 136 (1991)(holding that an 
itemized list of long distance calls placed by the governor’s office falls

within the working papers exemption). no record that is otherwise 
open to inspection shall be deemed exempt by virtue of the fact that 
it has been attached to or incorporated within any working paper or 
correspondence. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3705.7(2).  
b. records of certain but not all functions.
“Working papers” are defined functionally as records prepared by 
or for a public official for his personal or deliberative use. Va. Code 
ann. § 2.2-3705.7(2).  
2. Legislative bodies.
Working papers and correspondence prepared by or for members 
of the general assembly or the Division of Legislative Services are 
exempted from disclosure. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3705.7(2).  
3. Courts.
Petit juries and grand juries are specifically excluded from cover-
age under the act. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3703(a)(2). access to judicial 
records and proceedings is governed by other Virginia statutes and by 
case law. See, e.g., Va. Code ann. § 17.1-208.  
reports and court documents concerning involuntary admissions 
that are required to be kept confidential pursuant to Va. Code ann. § 
37.2-818 are excluded. Va. Code ann.§ 2.2-3705.5(6).  
4. nongovernmental bodies.
a. Bodies receiving public funds or benefits.
The act defines “public body” to include “organizations, corpora-
tions or agencies in the Commonwealth supported wholly or princi-
pally by public funds.” Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  Whether an entity 
is supported “principally” by public funds is a question of fact. Wigand 
v. Wilkes, 65 Va. Cir. 437, 438 (norfolk Cir. Ct. 2004).  non-govern-
mental organizations, corporations and agencies that are not support-
ed principally by public funds are not “public bodies” under the act, 
and, thus are not subject to its disclosure requirements. 1995 Va. Op. 
atty gen. 4 (January 9, 1995)(The general assembly did not intend 
for the act to apply to a private corporation receiving public funds to 
pay for property, goods, or services it provides, when that corporation 
is not supported wholly or principally by public funds.).  
b. Bodies whose members include governmental 
officials.
The presence of a government official on the governing body of an 
entity does not make the entity a public body. The body must meet the 
statutory definition, or be performing a delegated function of a public 
body as discussed below.  
5. Multi-state or regional bodies.
Such bodies are not statutorily exempt from the act. a circuit court 
has held that the act applies to a county industrial Development au-
thority. Lee Jackson Motel Inc., et al v. Industrial Development Authority, 
4 Va. Cir. 125 (Frederick Cir. Ct. 1983).  
6. advisory boards and commissions, quasi-
governmental entities.
The act applies to any committee or subcommittee, or other entity 
however designated, of the public body created to perform delegated 
functions of the public body or to advise the public body. Va. Code 
ann. § 2.2-3701. The presence of private sector or citizen members 
on such a body does not excuse the body from application of the act.  
7. Others.
among other groups excluded from disclosure under the act are 
(i) Parole Boards (Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3703(a)(1)), (ii) The Virginia 
State Crime Commission (Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3703(a)(4), and (iii) 
family assessment and planning teams established pursuant to § 2.2-
5207 (§ 2.2-3703(a)(3)).  
C. What records are and are not subject to the act?
Consultant reports. nonexempt portions of a report of a consultant 
hired by or at the request of a local public body or the mayor or chief 
executive or administrative officer of such public body are subject to 
the act if (i) the contents of such report have been distributed or dis-
closed to members of the local public body or (ii) the local public body 
has scheduled any action on a matter that is the subject of the consul-
tant’s report. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3705.8(B).  
Settlements by the Commonwealth. no settlement of a civil action 
against the Commonwealth involving money damages may be made 
subject to a confidentiality agreement prohibiting the disclosure of 
the settlement amount except where required by law or imposed by a 
court. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-514.  
Judicial Inquiry. any evidence of alleged misconduct concerning a 
judge who is up for election or reelection that is transmitted to the 
House and Senate Committees for Courts of Justice or to any mem-
ber of the general assembly loses its confidential character. Va. Code 
ann. § 17.1-918(B).  
1. What kind of records are covered?
a. General Definition of Records: “Public records” subject to the act 
are defined as “all writings and recordings that consist of letters, words 
or numbers, or their equivalent, set down by handwriting, typewrit-
ing, printing, photostatting, photography, magnetic impulse, optical 
or magneto-optical form, mechanical or electronic recording or other 
form of data compilation, however stored, and regardless of physical 
form or characteristics, prepared or owned by, or in the possession of 
a public body or its officers, employees or agents in the transaction of 
public business.” Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
b. Existing Records: The act applies only to records in existence and 
in custody of the public body at the time the request for official re-
cords is received. 1991 Va. atty. gen. 13 (June 21, 1991). The act does 
not require that a public body create or prepare a particular record if 
it does not already exist. See Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(D); see also Hale 
v. Washington, 241 Va. 76, 400 S.E.2d 175 (1991); National Rural Utili-
ties Cooperative Finance Corporation v. Greenlief, 27 Va. Cir. 140 (1992). 
However, the public body may summarize or abstract the information 
under terms agreed upon by the requester and the public body. Va. 
Code ann. § 2.2-3704(D).  
c. Types of Records: Public records maintained by a public body on 
a computer or other electronic data processing system shall be made 
available to the public at a reasonable cost. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-
3704(g). Videotapes, magnetic tapes, photographs, sound recordings 
are records subject to disclosure. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701. Booking 
photographs and mug shots are official records subject to disclosure 
under the act. 1990 Va. Op. atty. gen. 9 (august 30, 1990). But see 
Archer v. Mayes, 213 Va. 633, 194 S.E.2d 707 (1973)(Jury list is not 
an “official record” within the meaning of the act); cf. 1998 Va. Op. 
atty. gen. 5 (September 23, 1998)(audio tapes, lyric sheets and other 
materials submitted to State Song Committee competition constitute 
“official records” within the meaning of this act).  
2. What physical form of records are covered?
all physical forms of records are covered.  
3. are certain records available for inspection but not 
copying?
There is no distinction with respect to what may be copied and what 
may be inspected. The act provides that “all public records shall be 
open to inspection and copying.” Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(a).  
D. Fee provisions or practices.
1. Levels or limitations on fees.
Fees Limited to Cost: Charges for time expended in accessing, du-
plicating, supplying or searching records may not exceed actual cost 
Open GOvernment Guide virGinia
The RepoRTeRs CommiTTee foR fReedom of The pRess Page 3
to the public body in supplying the records. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-
3704(F). This limit also applies to records maintained on a computer 
or other data processing system. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(g); see also 
1989 Va. Op. atty gen. 12 (February 21, 1989)(Town may not charge 
newspaper reporter for the salary of town employee whose sole func-
tion for the time charged was to watch the reporter as he inspected 
the minutes of the town council.). note the exception in the act for 
the costs of creating certain topographical maps. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-
3704(F).  
Estimates: an advance cost estimate must be provided if requested 
by the citizen. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(F).  
2. Particular fee specifications or provisions.
not specified.  
3. Provisions for fee waivers.
There are no provisions to waive fees, but in practice fees frequently 
are not imposed for small requests.  
4. requirements or prohibitions regarding advance 
payment.
if the public body determines in advance that search and copying 
charges are likely to exceed $200.00, the public body may require the 
citizen to pay, before processing the request, an amount not to exceed 
the amount of the advance determination. The deposit shall be cred-
ited toward the final cost of supplying the records. Va. Code ann.§ 
2.2-3704(H). Before processing a request for records, a public body 
may require the requester to pay any amounts owed to the public body 
for previous requests for records that remain unpaid 30 days or more 
after billing. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(i).  
5. Have agencies imposed prohibitive fees to 
discourage requesters?
This behavior is encountered on occasion, generally at the local 
government level.  
E. Who enforces the act?
any person, including the attorney for the Commonwealth acting 
in his official or individual capacity, denied the rights and privileges 
conferred by this chapter may proceed to enforce such rights and 
privileges by filing a petition for mandamus or injunction. Va. Code 
ann. § 2.2-3713(a).  
1. attorney general’s role.
The attorney general has no role in enforcement.  
2. availability of an ombudsman.
The Virginia Freedom of information advisory Council has a staff 
that answers inquiries on a formal and informal basis, but does not 
perform any ombudsman function with regard to any public body.  
3. Commission or agency enforcement.
none.  
F. are there sanctions for noncompliance?
in a proceeding commenced against members of public bodies un-
der § 2.2-3713 for a violation of § § 2.2-3704, 2.2-3705.1 through 
2.2-3705.8, 2.2-3706, 2.2-3707, 2.2-3708, 2.2-3708.1, 2.2-3710, 2.2-
3711 or § 2.2-3712, the court, if it finds that a violation was willfully 
and knowingly made, shall impose upon such member in his individual 
capacity, whether a writ of mandamus or injunctive relief is awarded or 
not, a civil penalty of not less than $250 nor more than $1,000, which 
amount shall be paid into the State Literary Fund. For a second or 
subsequent violation, such civil penalty shall be not less than $1,000 
nor more than $2,500. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3714.  
ii. EXEMPTiOnS anD OTHEr LEgaL LiMiTaTiOnS
a. Exemptions in the open records statute.
1. Character of exemptions.
a. general or specific?
Specific. There are one hundred (100) specific exemptions provided 
for in the act. Va. Code ann. § § 2.2-3705.1 to -3705.7.  
all exemptions are to “be narrowly construed” so as to not “discour-
age the free discussion by government officials or employees of public 
matters with the citizens of the Commonwealth.” Va. Code ann. § 
2.2-3700.  
b. Mandatory or discretionary?
The excluded records may be disclosed by the custodian, in his dis-
cretion, except where such disclosure is otherwise prohibited by law. 
Va. Code ann. § § 2.2-3705.1 to -3705.7.  
c. Patterned after federal Freedom of 
information act?
although there are occasional similarities, the philosophy underly-
ing the Virginia act is to provide for very narrow exemptions.  
2. Discussion of each exemption.

of persons imprisoned in penal institutions, provided that such records 
relate to the imprisonment (§ 2.2-3706(F)(6)). Criminal incident in-

V. PrOCEDUrE FOr OBTaining rECOrDS
a. How to start.
all state public bodies created in the executive branch of state gov-
ernment and subject to the provisions of the VFOia must provide to 
the public upon request: (1) an explanation of the rights of a requester, 
the procedures to obtain public records from the public body, and the 
responsibilities of the public body in complying with the VFOia; (2) 
contact information for the person designated by the public body to 
assist a requester in making a request or to respond to requests; and 
(3) a general description of the types of records maintained by that 
public body; (4) a general description of any exemptions in the law 
that permit or require records to be withheld from release; and (5) 
any policy the public body has concerning the type of public records 
it routinely withholds from release as permitted by the VFOia. in ad-
dition, that information must also be posted on the internet. Virginia 
Code § 2.2-3704.1(a).  
1. Who receives a request?
The request should be directed to the agency that is the custodian 
of the records that are being sought.  
The governor is not the custodian of records for each and every 
public body in the Commonwealth. Davis v. Allen, 44 Va. Cir. 237 
(1997).  
2. Does the law cover oral requests?
Yes, the act does not mandate that the request be written. it is advis-
able, however, that the request be written if the requester anticipates a 
need to enforce his or her rights under the act.  
a. arrangements to inspect & copy.
requests for records must identify the requested records with rea-
sonable specificity. The requester need not make reference to the act. 
The public body shall reply within five (5) working days. Va. Code 
ann. § 2.2-3704(B). all public records shall be open to inspection 
and copying during regular business hours of the custodian of such 
records. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(a). The public body may make 
reasonable charges for the actual cost of duplicating the records. Va. 
Code ann. § 2.2-3704(F).  
b. if an oral request is denied:
The act does not distinguish oral from written requests. The re-
quester may pursue the remedies outlined in the act upon denial. See 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3714. if litigation is contemplated, it is wise to 
resubmit the request in writing. in the interest of establishing an un-
ambiguous record, written follow up to a denied oral request is recom-
mended.  
3. Contents of a written request.
a. Description of the records.
The act requires that the request shall identify the requested re-
cords with reasonable specificity. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B). Fish-
ing expeditions will not be allowed.  
b. need to address fee issues.
The act does not require that fees be mentioned in the request. 
However, if requesting an estimate for search and copying charges, it 
is best to put it in writing. if the requester asks for an estimate, one 
must be provided. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(F).  
if a public body determines in advance that charges for producing 
the requested records are likely to exceed $200, the public body may, 
before continuing to process the request, require the requester to 
agree to payment of a deposit not to exceed the amount of the advance 
determination. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(H).  
c. Plea for quick response.
not addressed.  
d. Can the request be for future records?
not addressed, but it is likely that a court would find it implicit that 
the act does not contemplate requests for records that are generated 
at a future date.  
e. Other.
The right to inspect and copy records, including future access to 
records, can be waived. Putnam v. City of Winchester, 47 Va. Cir. 249 
(1998). an employee may waive her right to keep her personnel re-
cords confidential. Concerned Citizens for Educational Excellence v. Rich-
mond Sch. Bd., 43 Va. Cir. 209 (1997).  
B. How long to wait.
Five Day Initial Response: The custodian must provide an initial re-
sponse within five working days of receipt of the request, informing the 
requester of one of the following:  
The requested records will be provided. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-
3704(B).  
all of the requested records are exempt from disclosure. a writ-
ten explanation must be provided explaining why the records are un-
available, making specific reference to the relevant code provision. Va. 
Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B)(1).
The requested records that are not exempt will be provided. a writ-
ten explanation must be provided explaining why some records are 
being withheld and must name the specific code section authorizing 
the exemption. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B)(2).
The requested records could not be found or do not exist. Va. Code 
ann. § 2.2-3704(B)(3).
it is practically impossible to provide the requested documents or to 
determine whether they are available within the five working days pre-
scribed and, therefore, the custodian shall have an additional seven (7) 
working days to provide one of the three aforementioned responses. 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(B)(4).  
responding with an answer not found in the act does not constitute 
a response for the act’s purposes. Fenter v. Norfolk Airport Authority, 
274 Va. 524 (2007)(informing the requester that the request has been 
send to a federal authority is insufficient).  
Additional Time to Respond: The custodian may obtain an additional 
seven (7) days pursuant to § 2.2-3704(B)(4) as long as he provides an 
initial response within five days. The custodian also may petition the 
appropriate court for additional time if there is an extraordinary vol-
ume of records requested and a response within the time limit will 
prevent the public body from meeting its operational responsibilities. 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(C).

2. informal telephone inquiry as to status.
not addressed, but not prohibited.  
3. is delay recognized as a denial for appeal 
purposes?
a failure to respond to a request shall be deemed a denial and con-
stitute a violation of the act. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3704(E).  
4. any other recourse to encourage a response.
not addressed.  
C. administrative appeal.
The act has no provision for an administrative appeal. informal ap-
peals to a public body’s chief executive officer or attorney are encour-
aged.  
2. To whom is an appeal directed?
4. Contents of appeal letter.
D. Court action.
1. Who may sue?
any citizen of the Commonwealth, including the Commonwealth’s 
attorney, who has been denied the rights and privileges under the act. 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(a)  
2. Priority.
Suits to enforce the provisions of the act must be heard within sev-
en days of filing. However, if the court is not in its regular term, the 
hearing must be given precedence over all other cases which are not 
otherwise given precedence. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(C).  
3. Pro se.
The act does not require that a requester to be represented by an 
attorney. it has been held that a person who appears pro se cannot re-
ceive attorney fees for a suit to enforce the act; however, he may re-
cover court costs. Fiscella v. ARHA, 50 Va. Cir. 102 (1999). The act 
overrides Virginia’s general ethical prohibition on the appearance of a 
corporate party without counsel. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(B).  
4. issues the court will address:
in accordance with a greater weight of the evidence standard, the 
Court will generally determine whether the public body has violat-
ed the act by either failing to timely respond to the request or im-
properly withholding records which are not exempted by the act. See 
RF&P Corp. v. Little, 247 Va. 309, 440 S.E.2d 908(1994)(standard of 
proof). The public body bears the burden to prove its entitlement to 
an exception by a preponderance of the evidence. Va. Code ann. § 
2.2-3713(E).  
“a citizen alleging violation of the rights and privileges afforded by 
the FOia and seeking relief by mandamus pursuant to Code § 2.2-
3713(a) is not required to prove a lack of an adequate remedy at law, 
nor can the mandamus proceeding be barred on the ground that there 
may be some other remedy at law available.” Cartwright v. Common-
wealth Transportation Commissioner, 270 Va. 58, 613 S.E.2d 449 (2005). 
Request For Injunctive Relief: The Court will determine whether the 
violation was willful, knowing, and substantial. injunction will not be 
granted where the procedural violation of the act is minor and unin-
tended. Shenandoah Publishing House Inc. v. Winchester City Council, 37 
Va. Cir. 149 (1994).  
Entitlement to Fees: Where the petitioner has substantially prevailed 
on the merits of the case, attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs shall 
be awarded, unless special circumstances make such an award unjust. 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(D). See Redinger v. Casteen, 36 Va. Cir. 479 
(1995).  
Imposition of Penalties: The Court will determine whether there has 
been a willful and knowing violation of the act. if so, a civil penalty 
will be imposed, as well as possibly a writ of mandamus or injunctive 
relief. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3714. RF&P Corporation v. Little, 247 Va. 
309, 440 S.E.2d 908 (1994). Penalties will not be assessed where there 
is a technical violation of the act. Mannix v. Washington County Board 
of Supervisors, 27 Va. Cir. 397 (1992).  
5. Pleading format.
no special pleading format is required that would not be used in a 
petition for mandamus or for injunctive relief.  
6. Time limit for filing suit.
Suit should be filed without unreasonable delay.  
7. What court.
Suits brought to enforce the provisions of this act shall be filed in 
the general district court or the circuit court of the county or city from 
which the public body has been elected or appointed and in which the 
denial of rights occurred. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(a). Suits against 
the state may be brought at the place of the aggrieved party’s residence 
or in the City of richmond. Id.  
8. Judicial remedies available.
The primary remedies are a writ of mandamus or an injunction. 
The former compels compliance with the act and the latter prohibits 
noncompliance. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(a). if court finds that the 
violations were willfully and knowingly made the court will access a 
civil penalty. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3714.  
9. Litigation expenses.
a. attorney fees.
attorneys’s fees can  be awarded where the petitioner substantial-
ly prevails and where there are no special circumstances making the 
award unjust. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(D).  
b. Court and litigation costs.
Costs and fees can be awarded where the petitioner substantially 
prevails and where there are no special circumstances making the 
award unjust. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(D).  
10. Fines.
if the Court finds that the violation was willfully and knowingly 
made, it will impose upon the member of the public body, in his indi-
vidual capacity, a civil penalty not less than $250.00 and not more that 
$1,000.00. The penalty for the second violation shall not be less than 
$1,000.00 nor more than $2,500.00. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3714.  
11. Other penalties.
in light of a requester’s repeated filings in the courts over the same 
matters that repeatedly had been rejected (over five times), the court 
granted sanctions in the amount of $1500, and costs and fees, but re-
fused to prohibit future filings because the next petition might not be 
frivolous. Davis v. Allen, 44 Va. Cir. 237, 243 (1997).  
12. Settlement, pros and cons.
Settlement of disputes under the act, like settlement of other dis-
putes, is encouraged. Settlement should be without prejudice to future 
assertions of rights under the act.  
E. appealing initial court decisions.
1. appeal routes.
a suit brought in general District Court may be appealed to Circuit 
Court for a de novo hearing. appeals from Circuit Court are to the 
Virginia Supreme Court.

2. Time limits for filing appeals.
appeals from general District Court to Circuit Court must be tak-
en within ten days of judgment. Va. Code ann. § 16.1-106. notice of 
appeal to the Supreme Court from Circuit Court must be filed within 
30 days of final judgment. Va. Supreme Court rule 5:17.

Open Meetings
i. STaTUTE -- BaSiC aPPLiCaTiOn.
a. Who may attend?
all meetings shall be open to the public unless the topic of discus-
sion at such meetings falls within one of the enumerated exemptions 
in § 2.2-3707 or § 2.2-3711(a) and the requisite closure procedures 
for exempted meetings are followed pursuant to § 2.2-3712.  
B. What governments are subject to the law?
The act applies to all public bodies, defined as “any legislative body, 
authority, board, bureau, commission, district or agency of the Com-
monwealth or of any political subdivision of the Commonwealth, 
including cities, towns and counties; municipal councils, governing 
bodies of counties, school boards and planning commissions; boards 
of visitors of public institutions of higher education; and other orga-
nizations, corporations or agencies in the Commonwealth supported 
wholly or principally by public funds.” Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
C. What bodies are covered by the law?
1. Executive branch agencies.
The act applies to all public bodies.  
2. Legislative bodies.
The act includes “any legislative body” in its definition of public 
bodies. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
3. Courts.
access to courts is governed by other Virginia statutes and case law. 
Court proceedings are presumed open under case law interpreting the 
Constitutions of the United States and Virginia.  
4. nongovernmental bodies receiving public funds or 
benefits.
Organizations, corporations and agencies that are not supported 
wholly or principally by public funds are exempted from the require-
ments of the act. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
5. nongovernmental groups whose members include 
governmental officials.
“Public body” includes “any committee, subcommittee, or other 
entity however designated, of the public body created to perform del-
egated functions of the public body or to advise the public body. it 
shall not exclude any such committee, subcommittee or entity because 
it has private sector of citizen members.” Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
6. Multi-state or regional bodies.
These bodies are not statutorily exempt from the act. a circuit 
court has held that the act applies to an industrial Development au-
thority. Lee Jackson Motel Inc. v. Industrial Development Authority, 4 Va. 
Cir. 125 (1983).  
7. advisory boards and commissions, quasi-
governmental entities.
See subsection 5 above. it has also been held that certain citizen 
advisory boards are exempt from the act. To qualify for the exemp-
tion, the committee (1) must not have been created by a public body, 
rather than by a member of the body; (2) must not perform a function 
delegated to it by the public body; (3) does not advise a public body; 
and (4) must not receive any public funds, including reimbursement 
for expenses. 1979 Va. Op. atty. gen. 316 (april 3, 1979).  
8. Other bodies to which governmental or public 
functions are delegated.
See subsection 5 above.

9. appointed as well as elected bodies.
Elected as well as appointed bodies are subject to the act.  
D. What constitutes a meeting subject to the law.
“Meetings” is defined as “the meetings including work sessions, 
when sitting physically, or through telephonic or video equipment 
pursuant to § 2.2-3708 or 2.2-3708.1, as a body or entity, or as an in-
formal assemblage of (i) as many as three members, or (ii) a quorum, if 
less than three, of the constituent membership . . . of any public body.” 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
Members-elect do not count toward the number necessary to con-
stitute a meeting under the VFOia. See Beck v. Shelton, 267 Va. 482, 
488, 593 S.E.2d 195, 198 (2004).  
1. number that must be present.
See above.  
2. nature of business subject to the law.
The act applies if the public body’s business will be discussed or 
transacted in any way. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
a. “information gathering” and “fact-finding” 
sessions.
Work sessions are defined as meetings by § 2.2-3701. However, a 
court opinion suggests that “information gathering” sessions are not 
meetings within the scope of this section. Nageotte v. Board of Supervi-
sors, 223 Va. 259, 269, 288 S.E.2d 423 (1982); but see Little v. Virginia 
Retirement Sys., 28 Va. Cir. 411, 433 (Va. Cir. Ct. 1992) (“Unlike a 
meeting between two separate and distinct entities, with separate and 
distinct areas of responsibility, a meeting involving two inextricably 
linked entities cannot be said to involve the business of only one of 
those entities.”).  
Public Gatherings: Where two city employees and three members of 
City Council were separately invited to a gathering at a street inter-
section to raise awareness over traffic concerns, no meeting within the 
meaning of the VFOia took place. Beck v. Shelton, 267 Va. 482, 493-
94, 593 S.E.2d 195, 200-01 (2004).  
b. Deliberations toward decisions.
a meeting held to discuss or transact public business is still a meet-
ing within the meaning of the act even where no votes are taken or 
decisions made. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3701.  
Non-Public Business: a meeting of Board of Supervisors to discuss 
communication and decision making skills is not a meeting subject to 
the provisions of this section. WDBJ Television Inc. v. Roanoke County 
Supervisors, 4 Va. Cir. 349 (1985).  
Informal General Assembly Meetings: The open meeting provisions 
shall not apply to informal meetings or gatherings of members of the 
general assembly. ACLU v. Andrews, 24 Va. Cir. 443 (1991).  
3. Electronic meetings.
Local public bodies are prohibited from meeting via electronic, 
telephonic, or video communications. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3708(a) 
(nevertheless, such communications means may be employed to ex-
pand public participation).  
no regular, special, or reconvened session of the general assembly 
held pursuant to article iV, Section 6 of the Constitution of Virginia 
shall be conducted using electronic communication means pursuant § 
2.2-3708. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3707.01(D).  
a. Conference calls and video/internet 
conferencing.
State public bodies may conduct any meeting to discuss or transact 
public business through electronic communication means. Where a 
quorum of a public body of the Commonwealth is physically assem-
bled at one location for the purpose of conducting a meeting autho-
rized under this section, additional members of such public body may 
participate in the meeting through electronic communication means 
provided such participation is available to the public. if a public body 
holds an electronic meeting pursuant to this section, the public body 
shall also hold at least one meeting annually where members in at-
tendance at the meeting are physically assembled at one location and

iV. PrOCEDUrE FOr aSSErTing rigHT OF aCCESS
a. When to challenge.
Promptly challenging the closure of a meeting is recommended. 
generally, an effort should be made to address the presiding officer, 
explain that the body is not complying with the requirements of the 
act, and request reconsideration of the motion to close.  
1. Does the law provide expedited procedure for 
reviewing request to attend upcoming meetings?
no.  
2. When barred from attending.
The individual may petition the court for a writ of mandamus pur-
suant to the act’s enforcement provisions. § 2.2-3713.  
3. To set aside decision.
The individual may bring a bill of complaint to set aside the public 
body’s decision in accordance with the act’s enforcement provisions. 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713. note, while it appears that if there was a 
substantial violation of the act, the Virginia Supreme Court would set 
the public body’s decision aside, they appear to do so reluctantly. They 
state “[u]nless there is a specific statutory provision for invalidation, 
courts are generally wary of imposing such a penalty for violation of 
‘open meeting’ or ‘right to know’ statutes.” Nageotte v. King George 
County, 223 Va. 259, 267 n.2, 288 S.E.2d 423, 427 n.2 (1982).  
4. For ruling on future meetings.
The individual may petition the court for injunctive relief in ac-
cordance with the act’s enforcement provisions. Va. Code ann. § 
2.2-3713. note that the court will not award injunctive relief where 
the violations are not willful and substantial. Nageotte v. King George 
County, 223 Va. 259, 269-70 (1982).  
B. How to start.
in accordance with the provisions of Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713, an 
aggrieved individual may petition the court for a writ of mandamus or 
an injunction for alleged violations of the act.  
There are no administrative appeals provided for under the act.  
1. Where to ask for ruling.
a. administrative forum.
C. Court review of administrative decision.
1. Who may sue?
any citizen of the Commonwealth, including the Commonwealth’s 
attorney, who has been denied the rights and privileges under the act. 
Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(a).  
2. Will the court give priority to the pleading?
Suits to enforce the provisions of the act must be heard within sev-
en (7) days of filing. However, if the court is not in its regular term, the 
hearing must be given precedence over all other cases which are not 
otherwise given precedence. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(C).  
3. Pro se possibility, advisability.
The act does not require that a natural person be represented by 
an attorney. in general district court, Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(B) 
relaxes the general rule of Virginia law that a corporate entity must be 
represented by an attorney. generally, assistance of counsel is advis-
able.  
4. What issues will the court address?
Entitlement to Fees: Where it has been proven that the petitioner 
substantially has prevailed in showing that there has been a violation 
of the act, the Court then must determine whether there are special 
circumstances making an award of attorneys’ fees unjust. Hale v. Wash-
ington County Sch. Bd., 241 Va. 76, 82, 400 S.E.2d 175, 178 (1991). See 
also Redinger v. Casteen, 36 Va. Cir. 479 (1995) (awarding fees).  
Imposition of Penalties: The Court will determine whether there has 
been a willful violation of the act. Penalties will not be assessed where 
there is a technical violation of the act. Mannix v. Washington County 
Board of Supervisors, 27 Va. Cir. 397 (1992).  
a. Open the meeting.
although mandamus and injunctive relief are available, this remedy 
often is not available given that closure of a meeting has already taken 
place.  
b. invalidate the decision.
not addressed.  
c. Order future meetings open.
The Court only will restrain a governing body from closing future 
meetings where there is evidence that there was a willful and substan-
tial violation, and that the violation will likely occur again. Nageotte v. 
King George County, 223 Va. 259, 269-70, 288 S.E.2d 423, 428 (1982). 
5. Pleading format.
Suits for injunctive relief or for a writ of mandamus are equitable 
remedies, and thus, a suit in equity is appropriate.  
6. Time limit for filing suit.
Suit should be filed without unreasonable delay.  
7. What court.
Suits brought to enforce the provisions of this act shall be filed in 
the general district court or the circuit court of the county or city from 
which the public body has been elected or appointed and in which the 
denial of rights occurred. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(a). Suits against 
state agencies or standing committees of the general assembly shall 
be filed in the general district or circuit court of the residence of the 
aggrieved party or of the City of richmond. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-
3713(a).  
8. Judicial remedies available.
The primary remedies are a writ of mandamus or an injunction. 
The former compels compliance with the act and the latter prohibits 
noncompliance.

9. availability of court costs and attorneys’ fees.
Costs and fees will be awarded where the petitioner has substan-
tially prevailed and where there are no special circumstances making 
the award unjust. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3713(D).  
10. Fines.
if the Court finds that the violation was willfully and knowingly 
made, it will impose upon the member of the public body, in his indi-
vidual capacity, a civil penalty not less than $250.00 and not more that 
$1,000.00. The penalty for the second violation shall not be less than 
$1,000.00 nor more than $2,500.00. Va. Code ann. § 2.2-3714.  
11. Other penalties.
none.  
D. appealing initial court decisions.
1. appeal routes.
if the suit was first brought in general District Court it may be ap-
pealed to Circuit Court for a de novo hearing. appeals from Circuit 
Court are to the Virginia Supreme Court.  
2. Time limits for filing appeals.
appeals from general District Court to Circuit Court must be tak-
en within ten days of judgment. Va. Code ann. § 16.1-106. a petition 
for appeal to the Supreme Court from Circuit Court must be filed 
within thirty days of final judgment. Va. Supreme Court rule 5:17.

B. By enacting this chapter, the general assembly ensures the people of 
the Commonwealth ready access to public records in the custody of a public 
body or its officers and employees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies 
wherein the business of the people is being conducted. The affairs of govern-
ment are not intended to be conducted in an atmosphere of secrecy since at 
all times the public is to be the beneficiary of any action taken at any level of 
government. Unless a public body or its officers or employees specifically elect 
to exercise an exemption provided by this chapter or any other statute, every 
meeting shall be open to the public and all public records shall be available for 
inspection and copying upon request. all public records and meetings shall be 
presumed open, unless an exemption is properly invoked.  
The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to promote an 
increased awareness by all persons of governmental activities and afford every 
opportunity to citizens to witness the operations of government. any exemp-
tion from public access to records or meetings shall be narrowly construed and 
no record shall be withheld or meeting closed to the public unless specifically 
made exempt pursuant to this chapter or other specific provision of law. This 
chapter shall not be construed to discourage the free discussion by govern-
ment officials or employees of public matters with the citizens of the Com-
monwealth.

forts to reach an agreement with a requester concerning the production of the 
records requested.

Parole Board providing the number of inmates considered by such Board for 
discretionary parole, the number of inmates granted or denied parole, and the 
number of parolees returned to the custody of the Department of Corrections

B. Public access to voter registration and election records shall be governed 
by the provisions of Title 24.2 and this chapter. The provisions of Title 24.2 
shall be controlling in the event of any conflict.  
C. no provision of this chapter or Chapter 21 (§ 30-178 et seq.) of Title 30 
shall be construed to afford any rights to any person (i) incarcerated in a state, 
local or federal correctional facility, whether or not such facility is (a) located in 
the Commonwealth or (b) operated pursuant to the Corrections Private Man-
agement act (§ 53.1-261 et seq.) or (ii) civilly committed pursuant to the Sexu-
ally Violent Predators act (§ 37.2-900 et seq.). However, this subsection shall 
not be construed to prevent such persons from exercising their constitutionally 
protected rights, including, but not limited to, their right to call for evidence in 
their favor in a criminal prosecution.  
§ 2.2-3704. Public records to be open to inspection; procedure for request-
ing records and responding to request; charges; transfer of records for storage, 
etc.  
a. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, all public records shall 
be open to inspection and copying by any citizens of the Commonwealth dur-
ing the regular office hours of the custodian of such records. access to such 
records shall not be denied to citizens of the Commonwealth, representatives 
of newspapers and magazines with circulation in the Commonwealth, and rep-
resentatives of radio and television stations broadcasting in or into the Com-
monwealth. The custodian may require the requester to provide his name and 
legal address. The custodian of such records shall take all necessary precautions 
for their preservation and safekeeping.  
B. a request for public records shall identify the requested records with rea-
sonable specificity. The request need not make reference to this chapter in 
order to invoke the provisions of this chapter or to impose the time limits for 
response by a public body. any public body that is subject to this chapter and 
that is the custodian of the requested records shall promptly, but in all cases 
within five working days of receiving a request, provide the requested records 
to the requester or make one of the following responses in writing:  
  1. The requested records are being entirely withheld because their release 
is prohibited by law or the custodian has exercised his discretion to withhold 
the records in accordance with this chapter. Such response shall identify with 
reasonable particularity the volume and subject matter of withheld records, 
and cite, as to each category of withheld records, the specific Code section that 
authorizes the withholding of the records.  
  2. The requested records are being provided in part and are being withheld 
in part because the release of part of the records is prohibited by law or the 
custodian has exercised his discretion to withhold a portion of the records in 
accordance with this chapter. Such response shall identify with reasonable par-
ticularity the subject matter of withheld portions, and cite, as to each category 
of withheld records, the specific Code section that authorizes the withholding 
of the records. When a portion of a requested record is withheld, the public 
body may delete or excise only that portion of the record to which an exemp-
tion applies and shall release the remainder of the record.  
  3. The requested records could not be found or do not exist. However, if 
the public body that received the request knows that another public body has 
the requested records, the response shall include contact information for the 
other public body.  
  4. it is not practically possible to provide the requested records or to de-
termine whether they are available within the five-work-day period. Such 
response shall specify the conditions that make a response impossible. if the 
response is made within five working days, the public body shall have an addi-
tional seven work days in which to provide one of the four preceding responses. 
C. any public body may petition the appropriate court for additional time 
to respond to a request for records when the request is for an extraordinary 
volume of records or requires an extraordinarily lengthy search, and a response 
by the public body within the time required by this chapter will prevent the 
public body from meeting its operational responsibilities. Before proceeding 
with the petition, however, the public body shall make reasonable efforts to 
reach an agreement with the requester concerning the production of the re-
cords requested.  
D. Subject to the provisions of subsection g, no public body shall be re-
quired to create a new record if the record does not already exist. However, 
a public body may abstract or summarize information under such terms and 
conditions as agreed between the requester and the public body.  
E. Failure to respond to a request for records shall be deemed a denial of the 
request and shall constitute a violation of this chapter.  
F. a public body may make reasonable charges not to exceed its actual cost 
incurred in accessing, duplicating, supplying, or searching for the requested 
records. no public body shall impose any extraneous, intermediary or surplus 
fees or expenses to recoup the general costs associated with creating or main-
taining records or transacting the general business of the public body. any 
duplicating fee charged by a public body shall not exceed the actual cost of 
duplication. The public body may also make a reasonable charge for the cost 
incurred in supplying records produced from a geographic information system 
at the request of anyone other than the owner of the land that is the subject of 
the request. However, such charges shall not exceed the actual cost to the pub-
lic body in supplying such records, except that the public body may charge, on 
a pro rata per acre basis, for the cost of creating topographical maps developed 
by the public body, for such maps or portions thereof, which encompass a con-
tiguous area greater than 50 acres. all charges for the supplying of requested 
records shall be estimated in advance at the request of the citizen.

g. Public records maintained by a public body in an electronic data process-
ing system, computer database, or any other structured collection of data shall 
be made available to a requester at a reasonable cost, not to exceed the actual 
cost in accordance with subsection F. When electronic or other databases are 
combined or contain exempt and nonexempt records, the public body may pro-
vide access to the exempt records if not otherwise prohibited by law, but shall 
provide access to the nonexempt records as provided by this chapter.  
Public bodies shall produce nonexempt records maintained in an electronic 
database in any tangible medium identified by the requester, including, where 
the public body has the capability, the option of posting the records on a web-
site or delivering the records through an electronic mail address provided by 
the requester, if that medium is used by the public body in the regular course 
of business. no public body shall be required to produce records from an elec-
tronic database in a format not regularly used by the public body. However, 
the public body shall make reasonable efforts to provide records in any format 
under such terms and conditions as agreed between the requester and public 
body, including the payment of reasonable costs. The excision of exempt fields 
of information from a database or the conversion of data from one available 
format to another shall not be deemed the creation, preparation or compilation 
of a new public record.  
H. in any case where a public body determines in advance that charges for 
producing the requested records are likely to exceed $200, the public body 
may, before continuing to process the request, require the requester to agree to 
payment of a deposit not to exceed the amount of the advance determination. 
The deposit shall be credited toward the final cost of supplying the requested 
records. The period within which the public body shall respond under this sec-
tion shall be tolled for the amount of time that elapses between notice of the 
advance determination and the response of the requester.  
i. Before processing a request for records, a public body may require the 
requester to pay any amounts owed to the public body for previous requests for 
records that remain unpaid 30 days or more after billing.  
J. in the event a public body has transferred possession of public records 
to any entity, including but not limited to any other public body, for storage, 
maintenance, or archiving, the public body initiating the transfer of such re-
cords shall remain the custodian of such records for purposes of responding to 
requests for public records made pursuant to this chapter and shall be respon-
sible for retrieving and supplying such public records to the requester. in the 
event a public body has transferred public records for storage, maintenance, 
or archiving and such transferring public body is no longer in existence, any 
public body that is a successor to the transferring public body shall be deemed 
the custodian of such records. in the event no successor entity exists, the entity 
in possession of the public records shall be deemed the custodian of the records 
for purposes of compliance with this chapter, and shall retrieve and supply such 
records to the requester.  
§ 2.2-3704.1. Posting of notice of rights and responsibilities by state public 
bodies; assistance by the Freedom of information advisory Council.  
a. all state public bodies created in the executive branch of state govern-
ment and subject to the provisions of this chapter shall make available the fol-
lowing information to the public upon request and shall post such information 
on the internet:  
  1. a plain English explanation of the rights of a requester under this chap-
ter, the procedures to obtain public records from the public body, and the re-
sponsibilities of the public body in complying with this chapter. For purposes 
of this subdivision “plain English” means written in nontechnical, readily un-
derstandable language using words of common everyday usage and avoiding

the public body.

official or individual capacity, denied the rights and privileges conferred by this 
chapter may proceed to enforce such rights and privileges by filing a petition 
for mandamus or injunction, supported by an affidavit showing good cause. 
Such petition may be brought in the name of the person notwithstanding that a 
request for public records was made by the person’s attorney in his representa-
tive capacity. Venue for the petition shall be addressed as follows:  
  1. in a case involving a local public body, to the general district court or 
circuit court of the county or city from which the public body has been elected 
or appointed to serve and in which such rights and privileges were so denied;  
  2. in a case involving a regional public body, to the general district or circuit 
court of the county or city where the principal business office of such body is 
located; and  
  3. in a case involving a board, bureau, commission, authority, district, in-
stitution, or agency of the state government, including a public institution of 
higher education, or a standing or other committee of the general assembly, to 
the general district court or the circuit court of the residence of the aggrieved 
party or of the City of richmond.  
B. in any action brought before a general district court, a corporate pe-
titioner may appear through its officer, director or managing agent without 
the assistance of counsel, notwithstanding any provision of law or rule of the 
Supreme Court of Virginia to the contrary.  
C. notwithstanding the provisions of § 8.01-644, the petition for mandamus 
or injunction shall be heard within seven days of the date when the same is 
made. However, any petition made outside of the regular terms of the circuit 
court of a county that is included in a judicial circuit with another county or 
counties, the hearing on the petition shall be given precedence on the docket 
of such court over all cases that are not otherwise given precedence by law.  
D. The petition shall allege with reasonable specificity the circumstances 
of the denial of the rights and privileges conferred by this chapter. a single 
instance of denial of the rights and privileges conferred by this chapter shall be 
sufficient to invoke the remedies granted herein. if the court finds the denial to 
be in violation of the provisions of this chapter, the petitioner shall be entitled 
to recover reasonable costs, including costs and reasonable fees for expert wit-
nesses, and attorneys’ fees from the public body if the petitioner substantially 
prevails on the merits of the case, unless special circumstances would make an 
award unjust. in making this determination, a court may consider, among other 
things, the reliance of a public body on an opinion of the attorney general or a 
decision of a court that substantially supports the public body’s position.  
E. in any action to enforce the provisions of this chapter, the public body 
shall bear the burden of proof to establish an exemption by a preponderance of 
the evidence. any failure by a public body to follow the procedures established 
by this chapter shall be presumed to be a violation of this chapter.  
F. Failure by any person to request and receive notice of the time and place 
of meetings as provided in § 2.2-3707 shall not preclude any person from en-
forcing his rights and privileges conferred by this chapter.  
§ 2.2-3714. Violations and penalties.  
in a proceeding commenced against members of public bodies under § 2.2-
3713 for a violation of § 2.2-3704, 2.2-3705.1 through 2.2-3705.8, 2.2-3706, 
2.2-3707, 2.2-3708, 2.2-3708.1, 2.2-3710, 2.2-3711 or 2.2-3712, the court, if 
it finds that a violation was willfully and knowingly made, shall impose upon 
such member in his individual capacity, whether a writ of mandamus or injunc-
tive relief is awarded or not, a civil penalty of not less than $250 nor more than 
$1,000, which amount shall be paid into the State Literary Fund. For a second 
or subsequent violation, such civil penalty shall be not less than $1,000 nor 
more than $2,500.
